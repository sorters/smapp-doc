\textbf{Event flow:}

\ucitem The Client calls the Add Trigger endpoint providing all the values for the mandatory attributes and optionally the values for the optional ones.

\ucitem The System responds with the ID (\textit{tid}) of the newly created trigger.

\textbf{Postconditions:}

\end{ucbox}

\begin{ucbox}{\subsubsection{UCTR004: Modify Trigger}}
\label{UCTR004}

Actors: System, Client

\textbf{Preconditions:}

\textbf{Event flow:}

\ucitem The Client calls the Modify Trigger endpoint providing the trigger ID (\textit{tid}) and all the values for the mandatory attributes and optionally the values for the optional ones.

\ucitem The System responds with the ID (\textit{tid}) of the modified provider.

\textbf{Postconditions:}

\textbf{Preconditions:}

\ucitem The trigger \textit{tid} exists

\textbf{Event flow:}

\ucitem The Client calls the Delete Trigger endpoint providing the ID (\textit{tid}) of the trigger to delete.
