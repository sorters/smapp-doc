Regarding the management of the cost, a strategy must be in place in order to control and oversee the correct evolution of these throughout the project development.

However, in the specific case of this particular project this will not be necessary in some cases. All the material resources have already been purchased or paid for, and no variations are expected during the project development. If any unforeseen circumstance would however cause further costs in this aspect, it should be taken into account at the end of the project, when the real final costs and the estimated ones are compared.

In this sense, therefore, the hours spent working on the development have to be tracked, both for the Product owner and Core developer roles. This data will also be compared, once the project is finalised, with the estimated amount. Additionally, a precise tracking of the time spent throughout the project can give useful insight and allow corrections of the budget and schedule, in order to adapt and avoid deviations.
