This project provides a solid and complete solution for basic stock management. However there are plenty of additional needs that can be covered, and features that can be extended and improved.

The idea of the project being open source is that, once the solution is provided and the goals achieved, further improvements can be added by contributions from the community, be it from users of the product or from open source enthusiasts.

Some of the features that could be addressed by these contributions include, for example, enhanced security and authentication, with more options to allow and manage access, user roles and capabilites. Further improvements can also be added for activity tracking and auditing, with features such as activity logging and auditing columns at database levels. Better support for installation on different environments and platforms would also be a good feature to address.

As said before, although this project is meant to be a generalistic solution, from this point onwards there are many directions this project could take by being extended and fitted for more particular purposes, and this is left at hands of the community.
