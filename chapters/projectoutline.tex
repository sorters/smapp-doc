The deadline for the delivery of the finished project is set on January 9th 2017. Considering the start of the project to coincide with the start of GEP, September 19th 2016, the total duration will be of 16 weeks. The project will be developed using a SCRUM-like methodology, with Sprints of two weeks. Therefore there will be a total of 8 sprints. There will be two spare weeks from the planned end of the project until the official defense. Those two weeks will act as a buffer in case any unforeseen circumstances force a variation in the schedule.
