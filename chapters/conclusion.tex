The development of this project has gone overall as planned. The proposed goal has been achieved as described in the formulation and bounded in the scope.

Regarding the timeline and schedule, working based on agile methods has been a huge advantage, because many minor adjustments have been needed to apply upon the original schedule. Having a broad big-picture schedule has allowed to undertake these variations in a transparent way, without having to change any of the major milestones, and still having the project on track.

On the way of working, the TDD-oriented workflow has also been, as expected, a great advantage. Although not many changes have been done to the original architecture and design of the application, some of the maintenance, refactoring and modifications have been mead easy by applying this paradigm, that not only helps during the original implementation, but will also help with further developments and maintenance.

Finally, and in a bit unexpected way, the development of this project has been an opportunity to finally learn and use Latex \cite{10}. Although it can entail some work before it becomes really useful, its rewards have been, as promised, plenty.
